​**Description**

The first fully functional MTKClient for Termux that works WITHOUT ROOT. Optimized 'Sniper' script for catching BROM/Preloader VCOM ports on unrooted Android devices via OTG.

# ​Key Details
​Zero Root Required: Unlike the original mtkclient, this version is designed to run in a standard Termux environment without root access.
​Optimized for Mobile: All GUI, Windows-specific, and non-essential files have been stripped to keep the script small and fast.
​Enhanced Connection: Features a custom polling loop that looks for USB devices thousands of times per second to overcome Android's single-look limitation.

​**How to use the tool**
1. ​First run the command you want.
2.​Then press Enter and wait for the text "Waiting for device connection...".
3. ​Then connect your target phone by holding its Volume Up and Volume Down buttons to the host phone via OTG.
4. ​Then quickly press OK on the Termux API popup as soon as it appears.
5. ​Then the script will handle the rest.

# ​📥 Installation
Install Termux and Termux:API from GitHub or F-Droid first. Do not use the Termux from Play Store, it is an outdated version and lacks the necessary package updates for this script to run.
```bash
​pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python git termux-api libusb clang binutils -y
```
# Using venv (i will add more option in future)
```bash
​python3 -m venv ~/.venv
git clone https://github.com/sameenataj427-collab/Termux-Mtkclient
cd MTKClient-NoRoot-Termux
. ~/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-deep .
```

​# Common Commands

# ​Flags that can be used in command and help to make work easy
​There are two types of flags that can be used; both have different formats to be used in:
​# First type:
​Format: python3 mtk.py [command] --[flag]

1. ​--force: Bypasses signature or size mismatches to force a flash.

2. ​--reset: Commands the device to reboot normally once the process is complete.

3. ​--skip [partition]: Tells the script to ignore a specific partition during a bulk read/write.

# ​Second type:
​Format: python3 mtk.py --[flag] [command]

​1. --nobatt: Used for devices that require being connected without a battery to trigger BROM.

​2. --stage2: Forces the SLA/DAA bypass payload for newer, secured MediaTek chipsets.

3. ​--debugmode: Provides a full log of the connection process to find where it is failing.

THESE ARE ONLY THE MOST USED FLAGS IN BOOTH TYPES , I CAN ADD ALL OF THEM, IF I DID THE REPOSITORY WILL BE 200 TO 300 LINS LONG AND IMPOSSIBLE TO READ
